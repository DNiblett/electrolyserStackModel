# electrolyserStackModel
A dynamic lumped model of an electrolyser stack (PEM and Alkaline) allowing prediction of stack and electrolyte/water temperatures as well as current-voltage output from power input. Implicit and explicit time integration to allow coupling with renewable energy time series.
